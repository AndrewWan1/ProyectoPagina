        It's the seventh generation of the 802.11 standard, expanding WiFi-6 and WiFi-6E innovations; 
        enabling higher speeds, dramatically improving responsiveness and reliability for applications 
        that demand high consistency and accuracy.
        It uses 320MHz channels, that are twice the size of previous WiFi generations, as well as 
        4K QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation), allowing each signal to more densely incorporate a larger amount of data 
        compared to 1K QAM.

        It's the sixth generation of wireless connectivity; its development has very specific main objectives, starting with 
        the reduction of latency, reducing the waiting time when communicating from a device to the network. 
        An increase in connection speed is also expected, resulting in faster downloads and real-time data transmission.
